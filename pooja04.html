<b><h6 id="3">Pooja Guideline</h6></b>

<h6>Sankalp</h6>
<p>Sankalp is the most important part of any pooja. It includes your name, Gotra, and specific wishes, and is taken by our Panditji to ensure the spiritual benefits reach you. We follow true Vedic tradition, one Sankalp for one pooja at a time. We do not perform group Sankalps, as it goes against scriptural principles. Each pooja is done individually, with full focus and devotion.</p>

<h6>Gotra</h6>
<p>Gotra is not just a surname — it represents your ancestral lineage and connects your prayers to the Rishis and your entire family. If someone is unaware of their gotra, the “Kashyap Gotra” will be used.</p>

<h6>Pooja Proof</h6>
<p>We provide photos or short videos of key pooja moments like Sankalp or Abhishek, usually within 2 days. In rare cases, if proof cannot be shared, your official Temple Trust receipt is confirmation.</p>

<h6>Pooja Schedule</h6>
<p>Your payment is verified within 24 hours. After verification, the pooja is performed within the next 48 hours.</p>

<h6>Pooja Samagri</h6>
<p>All materials are arranged by our temple pandit as per traditional rituals. Alternatives are used if something is unavailable.</p>

<h6>Prasad</h6>
<p>No physical prasad is sent after the pooja.</p>

<h6>Terms and Conditions</h6>
<p>Please refer to the full terms and conditions for complete details.</p>
