  <h6>Rudrabhishek</h6>
<p>Rudrabhishek means &ldquo;Abhishek (sacred bathing) of Rudra.&rdquo; Rudra is one of the names of Lord Shiva. This ritual is performed by devotees of Lord Shiva to seek his divine blessings. During Rudrabhishek, the Shivling is bathed with pure substances like water, milk, curd, ghee, honey, etc. While performing the ritual, sacred Shiva mantras are chanted, through which devotees seek prosperity, happiness, peace, and blessings in their lives. This is considered a highly auspicious ritual and a way to express devotion to Lord Shiva.</p>

<br><br><br>
<h6 id="3">Pooja Guideline</h6>

<h6>Sankalp</h6>
<p>Sankalp is the most important part of any pooja. It includes your name, Gotra, and specific wishes, and is taken by our Panditji to ensure the spiritual benefits reach you. We follow true Vedic tradition, one Sankalp for one pooja at a time. We do not perform group Sankalps, as it goes against scriptural principles. Each pooja is done individually, with full focus and devotion.</p>

<h6>Gotra</h6>
<p>In every pooja or jaap, a Sankalp is taken with the devotee’s name, Gotra, and purpose. Gotra is not just a surname — it represents your ancestral lineage and connects your prayers to the Rishis and your entire family, both living and departed. If someone is unaware of their gotra, they can still perform the pooja or jaap, and they will receive the full benefits of the ritual. In such cases, the “Kashyap Gotra” will be used during the pooja.</p>

<h6>Pooja Proof</h6>
<p>We provide photos or short videos of key pooja moments like Sankalp or Abhishek, usually within 2 days. Full-length videos or live streaming are not possible. In rare cases (due to technical issues, power cuts, etc.), if proof cannot be shared, please rest assured that your pooja was sincerely performed with full Vedic rituals. Your official Temple Trust receipt confirms that the pooja was conducted properly in your name. We humbly seek your trust in our commitment to Dharma.</p>

<h6>Pooja Schedule</h6>
<p>Your payment is verified within 24 hours. After verification, the pooja is performed within the next 48 hours. In most cases, we complete the process earlier, but this is the maximum time we may require to ensure proper ritual preparation.</p>

<h6>Pooja Samagri</h6>
<p>All pooja materials are arranged by our temple pandit as per traditional rituals. The cost is included in the pooja charges. If something is unavailable, a suitable alternative is used.</p>

<h6>Prasad</h6>
<p>Please note that no prasad or any physical items are sent after the pooja.</p>

<h6>Terms and Conditions</h6>
<p>Please refer to the full terms and conditions for complete details.</p>
