  <p>This is the sacred Shivling worshipped by Lord Shri Ram himself — the Lingeshwar Mahadev Temple, located in Rampal village near Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. Just as Lord Ram established and worshipped the Shivling at Rameshwaram, he also offered prayers and devotion to Lord Shiva at this very place. Today, this sacred site is revered as Lingeshwar Mahadev. Because of its divine connection, it is often referred to as the "Rameshwaram of Chhattisgarh."</p>

  <b><h6>Significance of Rampal in Ram Van Gaman Path About Temple:</h6></b><p>The Lingeshwar Mahadev Temple in Rampal is a sacred and significant stop on the Ram Van Gaman Path. During their exile, Lord Shri Ram, Mata Sita, and Lakshman passed through the Dandakaranya region (present-day Bastar) and rested at this very place near the banks of the Indravati River. Here, Lord Ram offered prayers to Lord Shiva with deep devotion. This historical and spiritual event has been recognised by Chhattisgarh government and also confirmed by experts from the Shri Ram Cultural Research Institute in Delhi, who have been conducting in-depth research on Lord Ram’s exile journey for the past 50 years. Because of this, Rampal is not only known as the “Rameshwaram of Chhattisgarh,” but also stands as an authentic and highly revered link in the sacred Ram Van Gaman Path.</p>
  <b><h6>The Infinite Shivling Discovered During Excavation</h6></b><p>This sacred Shivling remained buried underground for centuries. When the villagers began digging, a miraculous Shivling emerged. The surprising part was that even after digging up to 22 feet deep, the end of the base could not be found. Its structure was truly unique — the lower part revealed shapes in a divine sequence: octagon, heptagon, pentagon, square, and triangle, one after the other.This strengthened the belief that this is the same eternal and infinite Jyotirlinga mentioned in the following two ancient scriptures.</p>
  <b><h6>1. Test of Brahma and Vishnu, and the Divine Jyotirlinga</h6></b>Once, a dispute arose between Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu over who was the greatest. At that moment, a limitless divine Jyotirlinga appeared before them. Lord Vishnu went deep into the underworld, and Lord Brahma flew high into the skies — but neither could find its beginning or end. Brahma falsely claimed to have seen the top and took the Ketaki flower as his witness. Seeing this, Lord Shiva manifested from the Jyotirlinga, cursed Brahma that he would not be worshipped, and blessed Vishnu for his honesty by making him the preserver of the universe. The Shivling of Lingeshwar Mahadev in Rampal is believed to be a symbol of this very eternal and infinite divine light (Jyoti).</p>
  <b><h6>2. Bhasmasur and the Origin of the Shivling</h6></b><p>In the forests of Dandakaranya, Bhasmasur performed intense penance to please Lord Shiva and asked for a boon — that anyone on whose head he placed his hand would be turned to ashes. After receiving the boon, Bhasmasur tried to use it on Lord Shiva himself. To escape, Lord Shiva fled and finally took the form of a stone to hide. At that moment, Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of Mohini, enchanted Bhasmasur with dance, and cleverly led him to place his hand on his own head — causing him to be destroyed by his own boon. After this, Lord Shiva manifested at that very place in the form of a Shivling, which is now worshipped as Lingeshwar Mahadev.</p>
  <b><h6>Temple Renovation Work</h6></b><p>There was a time when the Rampal Lingeshwar Mahadev Temple had fallen into ruins. This sacred site was neglected, and many were unaware of its ancient spiritual significance. But now, under the leadership of the Shri Shri Lingeshwar Temple Seva Samiti, the temple is being lovingly restored. So far, support worth ₹32 lakh has been received, but to complete and give the temple a grand form, approximately ₹95 lakh is still needed. At present, the renovation work is being carried out with deep devotion and dedication under the guidance of the head priest, Shri Kailash Thakur Ji.</p>
  <b><h6>This Divine Shiv Dham is Being Built with Public Support</h6></b><p>This sacred temple is being built with the collective support of the entire devotee community. It is not just made of bricks and stones, but stands as a living symbol of every devotee’s faith, devotion, and spirit of service. Your contribution will not only help in the construction of the temple but will also support various religious and charitable activities — such as Abhishek and Pooja arrangements, festival celebrations, community feasts (Bhandara), cow service, and assistance to the needy.</p>Even a small contribution from you can help transform this Shiv Dham into a world-renowned spiritual center. Connect with this divine place, support the temple reconstruction, and earn spiritual blessings.</p>
  <b><h6>The Miraculous Water Pond</h6></b><p>Within the premises of the Lingeshwar Mahadev Temple lies a sacred water pond, believed to be miraculous. According to popular belief, bathing in this pond helps in getting relief from serious skin diseases and even leprosy. Devotees not only bathe here with faith, but also use this holy water to perform Abhishek of Lord Shiva, seeking healing from ailments and blessings of good health.</p>
  <b><h6>Shiva-Ram: A Sacred Union of Ramayana and Rampal</h6></b><p>Rampal is not just a village or a religious site — it is a living heritage of the Ramayana era. This is the very blessed land where Lord Shri Ram worshipped Lord Shiva and began his journey towards South India. This sacred place is not only a centre of deep faith but also stands as a significant proof of Lord Ram’s time in exile. That is why Rampal is considered a divine confluence of devotion to both Lord Ram and Lord Shiva.</p>
